## Description

This was an exam from Noroff school of technology and digital media, second year last semester:

"A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues."

### Requirements & API

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

The API used for this project can be found under Holidaze in the <a href="https://docs.noroff.dev/" target="_blank">Noroff API Documentation</a>
