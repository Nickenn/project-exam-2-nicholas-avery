Website for venue accommodation.

## Description

In this project I was tasked to create a accommodation booking site for a fictional company called Holidaze. The customer-facing side of the application requires a user-friendly interface that is easy to use. While the adming-facing side lets users register, book venues and manage their own venues and bookings.

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

The API used for this project can be found under Holidaze in the <a href="https://docs.noroff.dev/" target="_blank">Noroff API Documentation</a>
